This project has improved by getting inspiration from Martin Ohmanns repository. It also used the GPIO library from "github.com/brian-armstrong/gpio" in v0.5.0.

His Raspberry-Pi project "rfoutlet" can be found here:

For playback of mp3 files I use the great beep library (https://github.com/faiface/beep) and this is relying on oto (https://github.com/hajimehoshi/oto).
